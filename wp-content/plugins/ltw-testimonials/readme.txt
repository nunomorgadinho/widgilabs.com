LTW Testimonials is a powerful Wordpress plugin that will display client testimonials on your blog.

== Description ==

LTW Testimonials is a very simple yet very powerful plugin that will make your life easier when dealing with client testimonials.

You will be able to separate your client testimonials into unlimited number of groups which you can then display on different pages on a single blog installation.

Even if you have just one product or service, this will help you manage your testimonials much easier and quicker.

But that's not all. You can also customize the look and layout of the testimonials being displayed on the pages by simply editing the HTML and CSS code from the WP admin area itself.

It also comes with a widget where you can display random client testimonials.
